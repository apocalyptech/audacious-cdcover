ABOUT
"""""
CDCover is a plugin for xmms, which displays a graphic dependent on
the currently played song. Normal usage would be to display the 
CD covers for the different songs. The graphics are retrieved from
your computer. Therefore searchpaths can be defined, where a corresponding
cover is searched for.



FEATURES
""""""""
- Define as many different search paths as you need, including wildcards
- Buildin skin, full support for custom skins
- Many different graphic formats (supported formats depend on your
  gtk installation)
- Automatically resizes the images, and preserves aspect-ratio upon request



REQUIREMENTS
""""""""""""
- gdk,glib and gdk-pixbuf >= 1.2.2
- xmms >= 1.2.4

Tested on:
- Debian Linux (sid) x86 (gcc 2.95.4 and gcc 3.2.3) 



INSTALLATION
""""""""""""
A simple
	# ./configure
	# make
	# make install
should do the trick. Depending on your installation, you must be root
for make install.



SKINS
"""""
This plugin comes with a inbuild skin. However custom skins are fully
supported. You can download other skins on the homepage. For skin
creation see README.skin
The plugin searches for custom skins in this directory:
	~/.xmms/CDcover/
