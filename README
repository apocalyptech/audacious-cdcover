WARNING: This is almost certainly not the project you want.  It's only
on github so I've got it backed up elsewhere.  The whole thing could
use a gigantic amount of bleach.

Updated by CJ Kucera <pez@apocalyptech.com> since then, to support
newer versions of the support libraries (gtk, etc) and the media
player itself (currently Audacious 2.5.3, from Fedora 15).

The "REQUIREMENTS" down there are almost certainly out of date,
and you should take anything you find here with a huge grain of salt.

This project has also been since modified to be a little more proactive
about finding album art.  The gui should theoretically let you specify
a list of extensions to choose from, and a list of relative directories
to search in.  For instance, in my config it'll search for
cover.(png|jpg|gif) in the current directory, and then for the same
three files in up to two more parent directories.  I do this because
I keep multi-disc albums in separate dirs and tend to keep the cover
art in the parent folder.

Anyway, no guarantees as to whether or not the preferences screen
actually works or not; this has been essentially untouched by me since
I first hacked in support for it, and it's possible that I just edited
the gconf tree directly rather than fix a bug, or something.

Original README follows:

ABOUT
"""""
CDCover is a plugin for xmms, which displays a graphic dependent on
the currently played song. Normal usage would be to display the 
CD covers for the different songs. The graphics are retrieved from
your computer. Therefore searchpaths can be defined, where a corresponding
cover is searched for.



FEATURES
""""""""
- Define as many different search paths as you need, including wildcards
- Buildin skin, full support for custom skins
- Many different graphic formats (supported formats depend on your
  gtk installation)
- Automatically resizes the images, and preserves aspect-ratio upon request



REQUIREMENTS
""""""""""""
- gdk,glib and gdk-pixbuf >= 1.2.2
- xmms >= 1.2.4

Tested on:
- Debian Linux (sid) x86 (gcc 2.95.4 and gcc 3.2.3) 



INSTALLATION
""""""""""""
A simple
	# ./configure
	# make
	# make install
should do the trick. Depending on your installation, you must be root
for make install.



SKINS
"""""
This plugin comes with a inbuild skin. However custom skins are fully
supported. You can download other skins on the homepage. For skin
creation see README.skin
The plugin searches for custom skins in this directory:
	~/.xmms/CDcover/
